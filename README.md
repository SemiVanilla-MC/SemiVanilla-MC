# SemiVanilla Team

Welcome to the official Github org for the SemiVanilla Team. We are a team of Minecraft players with almost 20 years combined experience running Minecraft servers. We specialize in semi-vanilla and vanilla+ servers that provide a unique survival experience that players new and old can all enjoy. We set trends, not follow them.

Most content in this org is private and only visible by team members.
